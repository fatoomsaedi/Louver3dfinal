                <p>A Historical Look at the Meleager Statue
                    The Meleager statue is one of the most remarkable sculptures displayed in the Louvre Museum in
                    Paris. It depicts the legendary Greek hero Meleager, a famous hunter and warrior from ancient
                    mythology, known for leading the Calydonian Boar Hunt—one of the most epic tales in Greek mythology.

                    Meleager was the son of Oeneus and Althaea, and an oracle predicted that his life would last only as
                    long as a certain log remained unburned. After the heroic hunt, Meleager awarded the prize to
                    Atalanta, causing conflict with his uncles, which ultimately led to a tragic fate—his own mother, in
                    an act of revenge, threw the log into the fire, ending his life.</p>
